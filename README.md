This repo contains the code and instructions you'll need to ship logs from your Azure services to Logz.io.
At the end of this process, your Azure function will forward logs from an Azure Event Hub to your Logz.io account.

## Setting log shipping from Azure

### 1. Deploy the Logz.io template

ðŸ‘‡ Click this button to load the Logz.io template in Azure.

### 2. Configure the template

![Customized template](img/customized-template-step-2.png)

Make sure to use these settings:

**In the BASICS section**
* **Resource group**: Click **Create new**. <br />
  Give a meaningful **Name**, such as "logzioEventHubIntegration", and then click **OK**.
* **Location**: Choose the same region as the Azure services that will stream data to this Event Hub.

**In the SETTINGS section:**
* **Logs listener host**: Use the listener URL for your logs account region.
  If your login URL is app.logz.io, use `listener.logz.io` (this is the default setting).
  If your login URL is app-eu.logz.io, use `listener-eu.logz.io`.
* **Metrics listener host**: Use your the listener URL for your metrics account region (default: `listener.logz.io`).
* **Logs account token**: Use the [token](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/general) of the logs account you want to ship to.
* **Metrics account token**: Use the [token](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/general) of the metrics account you want to ship to.

At the bottom of the page, select **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above**, and then click **Purchase** to deploy.

Deployment can take a few minutes.

### 3. _(Optional)_ Add failsafes for shipping timeouts

You can configure logzio-azure-serverless to back up logs and metrics to Azure Blob Storage.
So if the connection to Logz.io times out or an error occurs, you'll still have a backup of any dropped data that didn't get shipped.

To do this, expand your function app's left menu, and then click **Integrate**.

![New Blob output](img/azure-blob-storage-outputblob.png)

In the top of the triggers panel, click **Azure Blob Storage (outputBlob)**.
The _Azure Blob Storage output_ settings are displayed.

Leave **Blob parameter name** blank.
Enter the blob **Path** for the Azure blob you're sending dropped logs or metrics to, and then click **Save**.

**Important:** Make sure the blob **Path** you're using here exists or create it now.

**Note:** For more information on Azure Blob output binding, see [Azure Blob storage bindings for Azure Functions > Output](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-storage-blob#output) from Microsoft.

### 4. Stream Azure service data to your new event hubs

Now that you've set it up, configure Azure to stream service logs and metrics to your new event hubs so that your new function apps can forward that data to Logz.io.
If you're not sure how to do this, see [Stream Azure monitoring data to an event hub for consumption by an external tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitor-stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs) from Microsoft.

### 5. Check Logz.io for your logs and metrics

Give your data some time to get from your system to ours, and then open Logz.io.
If everything went according to plan, you should see logs with the type `eventhub` in Kibana and metrics in Grafana.
